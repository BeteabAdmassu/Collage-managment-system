About the program:
	As we have presented in our project defense this program supports basic CRUD operations
	on  Teacher and Student datas.
Improvements:
	We have added some imporvements and features after the defense including validating user
	inputs, the ability to filter our the datas with the users desire and also we have added
	a feature for admin users to register new users for our program.
How to use:
	We advise the user to follow these steps respectively in order to easily use the program.
	1. The user must have installed MySQL and NetBeans Ide.
	2. Then the user must create a database with the name college other database names won't work.
	3. After creating the college database the user have to run the college.sql file included in the
	   folder to create all the necessary tables and to insert all the necessary datas.
	4. Then it's time to open NetBeans ide and import the GUI.zip file included in the folder.
	5. After that run the program and there will be a login page.
	6. If the user have run all the queries in the college.sql file then there must be a user 
	   with username 'user' and password 'pass' with admin privleges use that to login.
	7. Incase the user was not able to login with the afromentioned username and password
	   the user can directly insert a user data inside the users table
		the users table schema is uname varchar(10), password varchar(20), isAdmin Boolean.
	8. Enjoy using the program.
